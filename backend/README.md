#   Backend API Application

This application is a Spring Boot "backend" that exposes an HTTP/JSON API.

It happens to use [Spring Web on Reactive Stack](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html), but it doesn't really matter.

##  Build

    ./gradlew build

##  Run
